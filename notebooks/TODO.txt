TODO:

Fix GPU issue when saving model
automatic creation and loading of grid for experiments?
dropout
conf_matrix
srnn animation (almost there)
sound to spike (cochlea model)

DONE:
spike regularization, spike count (ok)
standardize plot_weights (ok)

LATER:
corradi's delay model (for later)
conv model as class (maybe create an abstract SNN model that encompasses common features with RNNs)



OTHER:
marshalling dvs to frames -> matlab


SPINNAKER:
consistency of different responses to SHD for every size
conv
