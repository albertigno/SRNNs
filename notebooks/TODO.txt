TODO:
automatic creation and loading of grid for experiments?
dropout
add spike count to dataset loader
sound to spike (cochlea model)
conv layer (maybe create an abstract SNN model that encompasses common features with RNNs)
one-to-one-layer
deep architecture
decorator for training_log
assert or try for has_propagated of SRNN monitor
use with TONIC

DONE:
spike regularization, spike count (ok)
standardize plot_weights (ok)
Fix GPU issue when saving model (ok)
srnn animation (almost there) / try celluloid?
conf_matrix (make more pretty)

LATER:
dilated-conv-like delay model

OTHER:
marshalling dvs to frames -> matlab

SPINNAKER:
consistency of different responses to SHD for every size (hard)
conv

RESEARCH:
review of training with delays
forward propagation
metrics for memory, synaptic operations in SNNs
